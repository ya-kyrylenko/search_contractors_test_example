Tools:

1. Ruby 1.9.3
2. Selenium webdriver

Test case

1. Run a <browser>
2. Clear <browser> cookies
3. Go to www.odesk.com
4. Click on "Find Contractor"
5. Enter <keyword> into search field and submit form
6. Parse 1st page with search results: store info given on the 1st page of search results as a structured data chosen by you (i.e. hash of hashes or array of hashes, whatever structure handy to be parsed).
7. Make sure at least one attribute (title, objective, skills, etc) of each item (found contractor) from parsed search results contains <keyword>. Log in stdout which contractors and attributes contain and which do not.
8. Click on random contractors title
9. Get into that contractor's details
10. Compare each attribute value is equal to one of those stored in the structure created in #6
11. Check whether at least one attribute contains <keyword>

Requirements:

1. Browser and <keyword> should be configurable. Test should run with any combination of them.
2. Imagine, what this is not such a simple tiny task, but big scalable project, thus implement appropriate OOP model/approach.
3. Prove model/approach chosen.
4. Every action, every comparison result, etc should be logged accordingly (i.e. to stdout). Goal: when your script pass - detailed test-case steps should be looged into STDOUT thus anybody can read it and repeat exactly the same steps and verifications but manually.
5. Code should be well commented thus anybody can easily findout what action is being performed there and what is the purpose of those code blocks/methods/etc
